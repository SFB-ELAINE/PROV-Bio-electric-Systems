# PROV-Bio-electric-Systems

A Collection of W3C PROVenance Model for the Numerical Modelling and Finite Element Simulation Processes of Bio-electric Systems.

The folder `model-based` contains a set of provenance models that correspond to the process described in

U. van Rienen, U. Zimmermann, H. Raben, and P. W. Kämmerer, “Preliminary numerical study on electrical stimulation at alloplastic reconstruction plates of the mandible,” Scientific Computing in Electrical Engineering, Jan. 2018. [Online]. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75538-0_1

Along with the model, we provide a set of pattern (`model-based/pattern`), that we identified during analysis.
